Small businesses the most important part of a country’s economy as they create most jobs and help GDP to grow.
But [unfortunately](https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2018/05/02/overcoming-top-small-business-marketing-challenges/?sh=43c6fa2375a1),
small businesses suffer the most. A study shows about 20% of small businesses fail by the end of their first year.
By end of their fifth year, 50% go under; and by the tenth year, that number rises to 80%.

There are lots of technologies and platforms that are available in market which can help small businesses to
overcome business problems and challenges. We will discuss the most common challenges faced by small businesses:

### Finding clients or customers

Big businesses hire marketers to promote and bring new customers every single day.
But due to lack of budget, small businesses cannot invest money on a continuous basis on marketers to bring new customers every day.
We can’t just sit around and wait for clients or customers come to us, we need people or technology
working hard every single day to find new customers or clients.

For small businesses the biggest challenge is “how to find new customers at limited budget?” Even after available of
technologies in market, the small businesses are still struggling, this is quite surprising! Most of the technologies
are costly, even after taking subscription businesses need external assistance to make it work effectively that increases
more expenses than the business expected on top of subscription. This is one of a big problem for small businesses,
but by partnering with CARIGAAR they can solve this problem; CARIGAAR will be the only platform where small businesses can
market as well as reach potential customers for FREE.

Sponsored Ads for sells or lead generation — 50% of small businesses feel they’re not getting a positive return on investment
from social media. 62% businesses say they fail in social media ads. As no one wants to be throwing money at ads that don’t
work! What good is such a massive pool of potential customers if you can’t successfully reach them? You’re paying for ads
that aren’t providing a return, which means you’re just throwing away time and money.

Its important to understand, what’s going wrong for small businesses? Businesses need to understand social media ads
are not like an ad you pay to have in local newspapers. A basic understanding of content marketing is necessary to see
success unless you’re just insanely lucky. You need to have multiple campaigns, each with different objectives, and
target audiences with varying levels of intent. 58% of small businesses are only spending an hour a week on their
Facebook marketing efforts, if you are only active on Facebook infrequently, then your ads will never be seen among all the
other noise. Even the reach of organic posts has been steadily declining as Facebook updates their algorithm. Also, most of
small businesses has very small budget to spent on ads, which restricts them from positive results. As we know there are so
many technologies available in market, but still small businesses are struggling, this is very surprising !

As per our survey the technologies available in market are not a complete solution for businesses.
As per businesses either they are costly to get all kinds of tools required for marketing or they need a third party to help them.
As a result, small businesses try for few months and then escape. They need a platform which they can use by
themselves and at affordable cost. CARIGAAR will be an ideal app for them, as they can handle by themselves,
and it has one flat rate for all services.

### Customer service

Most small businesses cannot afford to hire someone or a company for customer service. So, it become tough for them to
delight customers as they want. Limited budgets make it challenging to create programs that customers enjoy.

Small businesses really need to focus on customer service, so that their customers become promoters of their business,
as its way cheaper to retain an existing satisfied customer than acquiring a new one.

Currently there not many options for small businesses, whatever available are out of budget for small businesses.
By partnering CARIGAAR, small businesses can get technology to communicate and delight their customers.

### Hiring talents

52% of businesses says they struggle in hiring or the biggest problem is finding quality labour service.
Hiring and onboarding new employees can be costly. Because of high costs, its important to invest a significant
amount of time in hiring process. But mostly small business owners don’t have enough time and, they cannot hire an
external agency or technology to help them.

By partnering with CARIGAAR, businesses can reach and match up as their requirements
with best available talents in market at no extra cost than their regular subscription. In CARIGAAR we will have pool of
talents available from all trade schools in the region.

### Managing day-to-day business

Small businesses surely in need of a SAAS platform to manage their entire business, stay connected with team and customers.
It's very important to ensure your team has the essential tools to perform good work efficiently. As you can’t be everywhere,
at same time. But currently small businesses don’t have much option that are affordable for them. If this can be done properly,
it does payoff: and can bring revenue increment.

Small businesses can manage their entire business through CARIGAAR and at most affordable cost. Our SAAS platform will be the
easiest to use and help businesses to bring revenue increment.

### Handling finances

It very important for businesses to have financial resources for increasing efficiency and quality.
Capital expenditure for businesses is very important. Small businesses should use technology to handle invoices,
bookkeeping and use AI to analyze the financial situation that can help them to make good decisions.

### Marketing or increasing brand awareness

70% of brand managers say that building audience is more valuable than direct sales, and, because of this,
marketers say their primary goal is to run marketing campaigns to build business awareness. But for small businesses
it becomes impossible because of limited budget. There are lots of technologies and platforms that are available for
business, but unfortunately small businesses still struggle to brand their business.

Small businesses looking for something that can be affordable and can be done by themselves. Its should be
easy to use and can be operated through smart phone. Keeping all this in mind we are adding features in
CARIGAAR that will help small businesses to run marketing campaigns without any help from third party.

From our survey of 500 small businesses, we can across many business owners who are struggling or wasted valuable
time and money on social media ads or other marketing platforms, and several never used any technology for promotion.
Like a bakery owner says “he never used technology for marketing and knowing customer responses,” another business
owner says, “although I may get clicks or likes, it doesn’t always translate to more money coming through the door,”
putting it simply, another responds, “lots of impressions but almost no conversion.” So, its very important for small
business owners to have an app that can be affordable, no need of external help, can manage all by themselves from smartphone
and easy to use. Keeping in mind all this requirement we developed CARIGAAR, that can help small businesses to
compete, better customer service, in hiring and increment revenue. We also started a campaign
#NoSponsoredAdsChallenge to help small businesses from losing money in sponsored ads on social media.
