marketing platforms available in market. Then, why this products can’t help small businesses ?

Small businesses create the greatest number of jobs in market, almost accounting to 47.5% of all jobs. But that doesn’t

Also due to limitation of funds,
small businesses can not hire for one specific task, they need employees who can handle multiple tasks.

work for long hours, requesting staff to do the same or finding ways to cut corners. Small business owners must be
multi taskers. Because occasionally with shortage of time, business owners has to do multiple tasks to keep the business running.
But not a great solution, for a long run, they must find ways to grow business without just sustaining or hurting it.
