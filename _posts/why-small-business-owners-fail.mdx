Most of the small businesses fail due to lack of proper planning and, also they do not follow any proper [business](https://www.economist.com/free-exchange/2011/06/30/whats-so-great-about-small-business) models. With limited funds, if you don’t have a good strategy then it becomes super risky and high chances of failure.

The biggest of challenge is inadequate or lack of proper marketing and advertising, and it becomes hard for small business owners to compete with big businesses. I will try to discuss all of the causes that came across in our survey on small business owners:

**Funding –** Major draw back for small business owners is the cashflow, its not consistent. As a result they struggle to initiate any work for growth and even sometimes struggle to meet day-to-day activities. Irregularity in sales/revenue becomes a big hurdle for them to get financing from big banks, at the end lands to high interest financers and pushing the business to higher risk of failing in long run.

**Order/delivery issue –** Supply chain is an important part for small business owners, to keep their business running. Disruption can create a big damages. Issues like miss of order and delay in delivery, can simply become lost sales. So small business owners end up using high cost technology platform for delivery and ordering system, end up paying commission as high as 40% from their sales.

**Finding new/retaining customers –** One of the biggest problem for small business owners is customer retainment, they lack to hold their customers. Also they find really hard and costly to find new customers, as acquiring customers most of the time becomes costly for them. Without new customers coming, businesses tends to struggle and will not be able to grow. The [struggle](https://hbr.org/1983/05/the-five-stages-of-small-business-growth) is due to lack of time, money, resources, branding & awareness. Its also seen, many small businesses don’t have diversified customers base that can sometime cause big problems when there is economic downturn or sudden dip in demand.

**Business growth –** Its very important to grow your business, as growth can bring greater revenue and customer base. But small businesses struggle to maintain growth, due to lack of proper resources, goal setting and proper strategies. Also small [business](https://www.wsj.com/news/business?gclid=Cj0KCQjwwtWgBhDhARIsAEMcxeCggD1zP5CZF7LUHgnsjcWwJ6lQMFNeXE0zvt36y7TTA5UFLeMgEhkaAuMgEALw_wcB&mod=djmc_DGBus&gclsrc=aw.ds&ef_id=XapfigAAAGXqJgxi:20230318091239:s) owners unable to bring innovation, collaborations and high quality employees which generally help businesses to become successful.

**Customer Satisfaction –** Generally small businesses don’t have instant feedback system or instant communication system with their customers. They mostly depend on third party in receiving feedback or communication. So late response to unsatisfied [customers](https://www.wsj.com/news/business?gclid=Cj0KCQjwwtWgBhDhARIsAEMcxeCggD1zP5CZF7LUHgnsjcWwJ6lQMFNeXE0zvt36y7TTA5UFLeMgEhkaAuMgEALw_wcB&mod=djmc_DGBus&gclsrc=aw.ds&ef_id=XapfigAAAGXqJgxi:20230318091239:s) can lead to negative implications to businesses. One satisfied customer can bring 10 new customers by simply word-of-mouth.

**Time management –** Most of the small businesses stay under a lot of pressure to stay efficient and effective with their limited resources. As time management plays a very important role in planning and goal setting, which help businesses to make successful. But poor time management can lead to miss opportunities, waste resources and frustration for business owners. So, its very important for small business owners to focus on better business management and use of automation as necessary.

**Market Competition –** Most of the small businesses suffers due to huge market competition. As there can be numerous sellers for the same products and services, creating vigorous competitors. It can be a bottleneck situations for the business owners due to tight margins. As a result profit making can become hard, which can create tough environment for businesses to survive. So its very important for a small [business](https://smallbusinessbc.ca/article/understanding-your-competition/) owner to know about the target market and try to create a unique sell proposition for their business. So that they can pull new customers.

**Hiring –** Talented and skilled employees are very important for small business to grow. And most of the time small business owners [struggle](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rohitarora/2023/02/28/small-businesses-face-hiring-challenges-despite-fears-of-recession/?sh=3c30ded82c77) to find or keep skilled employees, due to lack of proper resources. They end up hiring wrong person, costing both time and money.

After meeting and interviewing 500 or more small business owners we can to the conclusion that the above discussed issues are few of the biggest problems small business owners are facing in their day-to-day business life. So, it’s very important for all of us to support our local small business owners and help them to grow.
