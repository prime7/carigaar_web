With years, now celebrity marketing is a growing [trend](https://toccarakarizma.com/blog/how-to-get-your-products-into-celebrity-hands/). There are many celebrities who have access to the niche market that you are targeting. It can help you gain brand exposure. Also probably a boost in sales. Who knows, what else ?

Endorsing your product through a [celebrity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/emmajohnson/2017/09/25/how-get-product-to-celebrity/?sh=53ba40656a3e) can be effective, as it can create a sense of desirability and trust. On various marketing research it's been seen, endorsing by a celebrity can increase sales by approx 4 percent. It's simple if a celebrity can be seen with your product then it can create a huge impact on consumers and increase awareness of your brand.

But the big question, can a small business bear the cost of endorsing a product by a [celebrity](https://www.cnbc.com/2012/03/05/how-to-get-your-product-in-the-hands-of-celebrities.html) ? How can you hand your product to a celebrity influencer? It's very important to figure out, as it's not easy, if you just send a product to a celebrity, then [probably](https://blog.hollywoodbranded.com/celebrity-endorsements-safeguarding-your-brands-reputation-against-misdeeds) the product will end up in their home. And the budget. As many times you have to give a free product or service, the question remains, how many times of free service or free product can you bear ?

Also too big a celebrity for a small business can overshadow the product in front of his/her popularity. It can be hugely [expensive](https://burkhartmarketing.com/pros-and-cons-of-having-a-brand-spokesperson/) for small businesses.

So thinking about using celebrities for endorsement? Not a bad idea. But you have to think twice - it can be tricky.
