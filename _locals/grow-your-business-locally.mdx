Small business owners make your product or services reachable to your local community.
Grow locally with Local. Our news page will help business owners to promote products/services,
offers and promotions. Local will be a complete news page only for small business
owners. Through Local we want to bring all “Mom & Pop” shops and all other kinds
of small businesses mainstream. As small businesses need a platform to shoutout,
where they can present their products and services with no bar. Yes social media
like facebook, instagram, tiktok, etc provides them to post, but with restrictions,
as there are lots of community guidelines to follow. At the end you won’t be able
to express your true business news, possibility of either blocking your news or your
profile. But in Local, business owners can express their thoughts, emotions and feelings
without any restrictions.{" "}

Small business owners start posting about your business, your thoughts, your business offers, your business promotions, about upcoming new products, your emotions, your feelings on LOCAL. Please feel free to reach Raj, our news reporter-cum-editor. Reach him at support@carigaar.com or call us at 250-682-3667.
