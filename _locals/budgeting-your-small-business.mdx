First thing we need to remember for every dollar we spent on local businesses, $0.63
comes back to our community. Creating an immense growth in local economy. Also there
is a ratio 24:1 which denotes local businesses gives back to community causes 24
times more than multinational organisation. But still small businesses in our locality
suffers the most.

As we talk with more businesses, small business owners in our locality are more worried about their future. Because they are struggling in hiring, in attracting new customers & in creating growth using technology. So its very important for us to support more to small businesses now than ever before, our discussions should be Shop Local.

Simple thing to understand by investing in a small business we are futureproofing our economy for long run.
